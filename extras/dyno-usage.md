# Dyno usage 

> **TODO** not sure what I am saying in this section

## Heroku App credits

  For each Heroku App you create you are given 750 free dyno-hours.  This 750 hourse is enough run a 1X dyno for an entire month free of charge.  Should you run two 1X dynos you can do so for Â½ of a month at no cost.

  As 2X dynos consume twice as many free dyno-hours per hour as 1X dynos. One 2X dyno app will run for free for 375 hours.

Likewise, PX dynos consume 16 times as many free dyno-hours per hour as 1X dynos. One PX dyno app will run for free for just over 46 hours.

> **WARNING** this is a warning, hopefully
