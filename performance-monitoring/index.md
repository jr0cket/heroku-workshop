# Performance Monitoring 

  Whilst Heroku has a highly scaleable platform to provide you will all the resources your application needs, the more performant your application is the less resources are required to scale that app.
  
  It is very important to understand the performance of your app and how that performance changes as you scale your app.   You also need to understance the performance of the connection between your app and other services (databases, caches, etc).
